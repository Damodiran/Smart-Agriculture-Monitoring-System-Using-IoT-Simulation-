Smart Agriculture Monitoring System Using IoT

This project focuses on developing a smart agriculture monitoring system that uses IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, and humidity in real-time, enabling precision farming and optimized water usage.

 📌 Project Description

Agriculture plays a vital role in the global economy. However, farmers often face challenges due to unpredictable weather and inefficient water usage. This project addresses these issues by using an IoT-based solution that collects and analyzes real-time environmental data to help farmers make informed decisions.

Core Objectives:

- Monitor real-time environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
- Reduce manual labor and water wastage through automated data collection.
- Provide accurate insights to improve crop productivity.

 
📊 Dataset Example

| Humidity | Temperature | Moisture |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| 90%      | 42°C        | 72%      |
| 94%      | 23°C        | 56%      |
| 57%      | 21°C        | 58%      |
| ...      | ...         | ...      |
